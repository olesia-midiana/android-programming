The oldest version of Android that the exercises in this book support is API level 21 (Lollipop).

In addition to the minimum supported version, you can also set the target version and the compile version.
All these properties are set in the build.gradle file in your app module.

Improvements in Android Lint, potential
problems caused by calling newer code on older devices can be caught at compile time.
If you use code from a higher version than your minimum SDK, Android Lint will report build errors.

across Android versions.
